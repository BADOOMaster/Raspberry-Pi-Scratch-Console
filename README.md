# Raspberry-Pi-Scratch-Console
This is a Scratch Console project that is going to be made using electron.
What in the end product will do is have a working scratch game player. 
This project will be under the GNU Public License. 
If you would like to help this project then ask me or other project members.
And finally we need people to test this to make sure it will work on a Raspberry Pi!
